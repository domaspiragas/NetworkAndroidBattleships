I noticed while debugging that the email verification from firebase sometimes takes a long time to
send. I found that spamming the "Send Verification" Button tends to work more quickly than simply
waiting. However, sometimes I needed to spam for like 5 minutes before I actually got an email,
and then I would be receiving emails spread throughout the next hour.

In case you are having these issues and don't have the time to wait, here are the credentials
for a few verified accounts.

I used my Assignment3 as the base for this, which is why there are still references to Assignment3.

Thanks for the great semester. I definitely learned a lot!
